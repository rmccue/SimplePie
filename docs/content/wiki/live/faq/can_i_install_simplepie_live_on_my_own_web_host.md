We currently have no plans to release an installable version of SimplePie Live as we maintain the application (including all the updates, improvements, and configurations) so you don't have to worry about anything. However we do offer the <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>-based [SimplePie](http://simplepie.org) software for installation which allows you to tweak and configure to your heart's content.
