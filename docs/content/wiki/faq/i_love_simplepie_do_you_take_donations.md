Donations are a tricky thing. We've talked about setting up something with Paypal, but splitting things 50-50 and having the money converted between US Dollars and British Pounds Sterling is far too complicated for the time being. Instead, if you're looking to reward our hard work, please consider buying us something from our Amazon wishlists (see below). It's much easier that way, and getting random presents from strangers throughout the year is like having our birthdays and christmas a few times a year. :)
