Sort of.

Is there a way to hack together a new feed from SimplePie data? Yes. See [http://simplepie.org/support/viewtopic.php?id=1068](/support/viewtopic.php?id=1068 "http://simplepie.org/support/viewtopic.php?id=1068")

Is there a clean, programmatic way of generating new feeds? Not yet. In SimplePie 2.0, we're planning to move to <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>'s <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr> extension, which will make things like this very easy with very little overhead. Until then, SimplePie will continue to strive to be the best way to manage the reading of feeds in <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>.
