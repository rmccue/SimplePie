SimplePie 1.0 introduces the ability to grab data from any element in the feed, even if there aren't public methods for grabbing them. This is a popular feature among <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> hackers.

SimplePie maps data by the namespace <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>, and from there you can use <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr>'s [print_r()](http://php.net/print_r) function to navigate the rest of the way through the array. This example shows you how to get an event's start date from a Google Calendar feed. Not only will we find this date data, but we'll reformat it and then sort the items chronologically based on it.

We'll use the [get_item_tags()](@/wiki/reference/simplepie_item/get_item_tags.md) in this example, although we could also use [get_channel_tags()](@/wiki/reference/simplepie/get_channel_tags.md) for the feed-level data.

<div class="warning">

This tutorial assumes that you're already familiar with using SimplePie, including looping through items. This is only sample code, and you should not create real pages using the (horrid) <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> generated by this example.

## Compatibility {#compatibility}

- Supported in SimplePie 1.0.
- Code in this tutorial should be compatible with <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> 4.3 or newer, and should not use <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> short tags, in order to support the largest number of <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> installations.

## Code source {#code_source}

```php
<?php
// Make sure that SimplePie is loaded
require_once('../simplepie.inc');

// Let's create a new SimplePie object
$feed = new SimplePie();

// This is the feed we'll use
$feed->set_feed_url('http://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/eventi%40emmealcubo.com/public/full');

// Let's turn this off because we're just going to re-sort anyways, and there's no reason to waste CPU doing it twice.
$feed->enable_order_by_date(false);

// Initialize the feed so that we can use it.
$feed->init();

// Make sure the content is being served out to the browser properly.
$feed->handle_content_type();

// We'll use this for re-sorting the items based on the new date.
$temp = array();

foreach ($feed->get_items() as $item) {

    // We want to grab the Google-namespaced <gd:when> tag.
    $when = $item->get_item_tags('http://schemas.google.com/g/2005', 'when');

    // Once we grab the tag, let's grab the startTime attribute
    $date = $when[0]['attribs']['']['startTime'];

    // Let's convert it all to UNIX timestamp. This will be used for sorting.
    $sortDate = SimplePie_Misc::parse_date($date);

    // Let's format it with date(). This will be the date we display.
    $gCalDate = date('j M Y', $sortDate);

    // This is how each item will be displayed. We're adding it to the array we created earlier, and indexing it by the $sortDate.
    $temp[$sortDate] = '<p>' . $item->get_title() . ' <small> &mdash; ' . $gCalDate . '</small></p>';
}

// Change this to krsort() to display with the furthest event first.
ksort($temp);

// Loop through the (now sorted) array, and display what we wanted.
foreach ($temp as $paragraph) {
    echo $paragraph;
}
?>
```

## Notes {#notes}

If there is a tag in the feed that does not have a namespace (i.e. `<thumb>` instead of `<media:thumbnail>`), use an empty string for the `$namespace` parameter.
