## What makes SimplePie Add-ons so cool? {#what_makes_simplepie_add-ons_so_cool}

SimplePie Add-ons allow you to add all sorts of cool new functionality to SimplePie _without ever having to edit a line of SimplePie!_ You can leave your `simplepie.inc` file untouched (making it easier to upgrade to newer releases), and still be able to extend it to your heart's delight with cool new functionality!

Is there something that you'd like to SimplePie do that it doesn't already do out-of-the-box? Have you built an add-on for SimplePie that allows it to do cool, new things? This is a list of links for documentation for all of the SimplePie add-ons that we are aware of. **Let's try to keep this list alphabetized so that it stays well-organized.**
