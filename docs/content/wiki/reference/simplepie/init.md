## Description {#description}

```php
class SimplePie {
    init ()
}
```

This is what makes everything happen. Period. This is where all of the configuration options get processed, feeds are fetched, cached, and parsed, and all of that other good stuff. This is called automatically if you pass a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> to the [SimplePie](@/wiki/reference/simplepie/_index.md) constructor.

## Availability {#availability}

- Available since SimplePie Preview Release.
- Previously existed as `simplepie()` since SimplePie 0.8.

## Examples {#examples}

- See the examples on the [SimplePie](@/wiki/reference/simplepie/_index.md) page (or pretty much any other page) for examples.
