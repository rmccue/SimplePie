## Changes {#changes}

- Re-wrote software from scratch.
- Dropped dependency on [MagpieRSS](http://magpierss.sf.net), and built software around [XMLize](http://hansanderson.com/php/xml/).
- Removed all external dependencies (all necessary functions are built-in).
- Maintained functional backwards compatibility with SimplePie 0.8.
- Increased the <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> processing speed by 100 to over 200 times, depending on the power of the hosting server.
- Slimmed down overall <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> parsing package size by more than 75%.
- Created online demo to show speed differences between old architecture and new.
