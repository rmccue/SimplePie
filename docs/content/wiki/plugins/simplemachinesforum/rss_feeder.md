## About the Plugin {#about_the_plugin}

This plugin has just about everything you'd need for working with feeds in SMF, and has a TON of features including:

- Unlimited Feeds
- Post to any board on your site
- Specify which user to post as
- Single click enable/disable of any feed from the admin panel
- Lock feed topics once posted
- Require approval of feeds before publicly viewable (only if Post Moderation is enabled)
- Prefix feed with any title (Ie: \[FEED\], \[<abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr>\], \[NEWS\], etc)
- Retrieve full article (Regular Expression REQUIRED)
- Find articles by keyword in the Title or Description
- Specify number of items to import from each feed
- Caching of feeds for faster performance in case the feed hasn't changed
- Logging of posted feeds to avoid duplicates
- Uses Scheduled Tasks to determine when to fetch feeds (you can set the frequency)
- Log pruning - removes log entries that are 30 days old (this can be changed too)
- Option to post all feed items into a single topic, instead of seperate topics
- See how many items each feed as posted
- Selectable image icons for feeds
- Add a custom footer to each post for feeds
