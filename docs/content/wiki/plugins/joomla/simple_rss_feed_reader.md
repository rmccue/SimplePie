### About the Plugin {#about_the_plugin}

Adding <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> syndicated content inside your Joomla! website is now super-easy and simple with the “Simple <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> Feed Reader” Module from JoomlaWorks. All you have to do is insert the Feed (<abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr>) URLs of the websites you want to syndicate in the module's settings, publish the module in some position and that's it! You can even publish multiple feeds at the same time (meaning in the same module instance) and even filter the latest X number, which you specify in the module parameters!

No messing with the code and no worrying about feed encoding. You can publish right away english along with japanese <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> feeds and have nothing to worry about!

The “Simple <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> Feed Reader” module is based on the very popular SimplePie <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> Class, which makes it easy to integrate syndicated content into your Joomla! website — and you don’t even have to worry about what kind of feed it is! The “Simple <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> Feed Reader” module supports everything from the old-school <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> 0.91 and <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> 1.0 formats, to the ever-popular <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> 2.0 format, and also supports the emerging Atom format, in both 0.3 and 1.0 flavors. It has a very fast, very efficient caching system. By caching the processed data, rather than just the raw <abbr title="Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>, the module is able to create a feed parser that's really, really quick.

The feeds are stored inside Joomla!'s cache folder and refreshed in a specific time interval, which you set in the module's parameters.

See the “Simple <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> Feed Reader” module in action in our exclusive demo site at: <http://demo.joomlaworks.gr>

For real world examples, see the module on the following websites: 1. <http://www.cinemad.gr> 2. <http://www.danaoscinema.gr>

So, now, a) you have no reason not to use <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> feeds in your website (cause you thought <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> was difficult to setup), b) you have a module that will bring new content to your website, efficiently and with style and c) you can have multiple feeds display in a single place (we hope 20 is enough!).

The “Simple <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> Feed Reader” module is released under the GNU/<abbr title="GNU General Public License">GPL</abbr> license.

Enjoy!

### What Do I Need To Know? {#what_do_i_need_to_know}

In order for the module to work properly, your server must have the following <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> modules enabled: cURL, iconv, PCRE, Zlib. Don't worry, though, cause most servers have these <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> modules enabled by default. If not, then contact your hosting company to enable them.

Please note that some <abbr title="Rich Site Summary">RSS</abbr> feeds might not display well even if you have the above <abbr title="Hypertext Preprocessor">PHP</abbr> modules installed (rare occasion, but can happen). That is entirely based on how the server is setup and if the specific language -with which you have issues- is properly defined in the server. In any case, contacting your hosting company is always the safest solution.

The module already includes some generic <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> styling, which makes it truely “plug and play” for your Joomla! website. The output is entirely controlled through <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, so you can customize it as you like.
