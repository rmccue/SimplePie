### About SimplePie Core {#about_simplepie_core}

From time to time, we get messages in support about people using multiple Drupal modules that utilize SimplePie, and sometimes they cause collisions because each plugin is bundling their own copy of SimplePie. In an effort to make things easier, we've released a new Drupal module that does absolutely nothing but load the latest version of SimplePie. This plugin is called **SimplePie Core**.

### Why? {#why}

There are a couple of reasons:

1.  To eliminate conflicts between multiple SimplePie-based modules installed at the same time.
2.  To make it easier for people to get the latest SimplePie enhancements without requiring a new release from Drupal module developers.
3.  And stuff.
