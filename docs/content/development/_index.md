#### SimplePie Git Repository

</div>

Want to take a look at our in-development code? You can view the files on the web, or download them with a [Git](http://git-scm.com/) client like [msysgit](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/) or [GitX](http://gitx.frim.nl/). A couple of notes:

1.  _The master version is always changing._ We try to maintain a relatively stable trunk at all times, but sometimes stuff is just broken.
2.  We only support the _current "official" release and the <u>very latest</u> master build_. If a bug exists in a master build, make sure you're running the very latest build before reporting it.
3.  You have _read-only access to the repository_. You do not have the ability to commit changes, although patches and suggestions are ALWAYS welcome at our [bug tracker](http://github.com/simplepie/simplepie/issues).
4.  _New features may not be documented._ [Function documentation for the trunk build is available](http://php5.simplepie.org/phpDoc/), however if you have a question about how something should work, ask in support mailing list.
5.  _Get the latest development code._ Grab it from [Git](http://github.com/simplepie/simplepie/) or download [as a tarball](http://github.com/simplepie/simplepie/tarball/master).
