#### Our Many Methods of Support

Something wrong with your (or our) code? We're here to help.

- [**Documentation Wiki**](@/wiki/_index.md) — The wiki is loaded with documentation, tutorials, code samples and other bits of information contributed by the SimplePie community.
- [**SimplePie Support List**](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/simplepie-support/) — Whether you actually need support or not, there's a TON you can learn about using SimplePie simply by subscribing to the mailing list and reading what comes through.
- [**SimplePie Development List**](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/simplepie-dev/) — This is the development-related mailing list. This is NOT for support issues, but rather for discussions about SimplePie as a development project.
- [**Bug Tracker**](http://github.com/simplepie/simplepie/issues) — This is where we keep track of bugs and feature requests for all SimplePie-related projects.
- [**IRC Chat**](irc://irc.freenode.net/simplepie/) — Sometimes questions or issues need a more immediate response, and for that we have our [IRC Channel](irc://irc.freenode.net/simplepie/). Looking for an IRC client? We recommend [Colloquy](http://colloquy.info/) for Mac OS X and [mIRC](http://www.mirc.com/) for Windows.
- [**Stack Overflow**](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/simplepie) — Like all great programmers, we use Stack Overflow for our programming questions — and you can too! We keep an eye on anything tagged "simplepie", so ask away!
