Weâ€™re looking for information from you all on how youâ€™re implementing cron jobs to work with SimplePie. We know that there are many of you doing this very thing, and we were thinking it would be nice to have such a tutorial on-hand.

So, weâ€™ve created a placeholder page in the wiki for [Setting up a cron job with SimplePie](/wiki/tutorial/setting_up_a_cron_job_with_simplepie). If you have any suggestions or tips for doing so, please begin editing the page for this tutorial in the wiki. If you come to the tutorial page and somebody has already written something up, please take a moment to read over it and see if thereâ€™s any other valuable information or tips that you can provide.

SimplePie users from around the world would be most grateful. ðŸ™‚
