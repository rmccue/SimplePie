Our little team is growing! As of this week, we’ve added two more “official” members to the SimplePie development team: Ryan McCue and Michael Shipley!

If you’ve spent any amount of time in SimplePie support mailing list, you’ll immediately recognize these names. They’ve both been very helpful and influential in the mailing list, they’ve shown a solid understanding of how SimplePie works, and they’re both using SimplePie in projects of theirs.

We appreciate the time they’ve put into SimplePie up to this point, and we believe they’ll be even more valuable going forward as they begin to improve SimplePie itself. Let’s all take a moment to leave a comment and welcome them! 🙂
