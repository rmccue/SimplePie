SimplePie 2 is both a fork and a ground-up re-write of SimplePie. The intention is to enhance the performance by trimming the fat, to build something more extensible, to make it easier to contribute, and to optimize for the kinds of tasks that we see people wanting to do frequently.

That being said, I took some time to write down some thoughts about what should go into SimplePie 2, and I would really like to get your thoughts as well. Are there things that SP2 should do that SP1 doesnâ€™t? Would you like to use SimplePie in ways that are currently more difficult than they should be? Are you somebody who has a different design philosophy and you think we should pay better attention to certain things? This is your chance to weigh in with your thoughts, opinions, comments, and other feedback.

Please check out [Goals for SimplePie 2](/wiki/sp2/goals). Feel free to edit, change, and improve whatâ€™s there. Feel free to argue with what Iâ€™ve written. Letâ€™s make this plan better together! ðŸ™‚
