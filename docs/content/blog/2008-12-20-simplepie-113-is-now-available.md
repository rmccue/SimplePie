[SimplePie 1.1.3](/downloads/) is now available (like 1.1.2, “core” plugin will be updated soon). This is a bugfix-only release that resolves the one major issue that 1.1.2 created (gzip decoding errors while using fsockopen()), and fully resolves the other major issue that 1.1.2 didn’t fully address (a workaround of a libxml2 bug).

Grab [the latest release](/downloads/) to upgrade!
