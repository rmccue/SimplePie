We’ve updated our plugins for [WordPress](/docs/plugins/wordpress/), [Textpattern](/docs/plugins/textpattern/), and [Mediawiki](/docs/plugins/mediawiki/) to version 1.2. In this release, we’ve added a couple of new keywords/attributes: `showtitle` can hide or show the feed’s title, and `alttitle` allows you to set a custom feed title.

If you’re currently using one of these plugins, you can simply replace the old file with the new one to upgrade. If you haven’t taken the SimplePie plunge yet, these plugins make it easy to bring feeds into your sites. Check them out!
