**SimplePie 1.0 Beta 3 is now available!** This release took much longer than initially expected to wrap up, but we wanted to make sure we had as stable a release as possible. There are very few API _changes_, no breakages, and lots of additions. Check out the [Function Documentation](/docs/reference/) for all of the new functions, the [Upgrade Guide](/docs/upgrade/) for changes you might want to be aware of, the [Release Notes](/docs/misc/release-notes/beta3/) for Beta 3, and the [Credits](/docs/misc/credit/) where we make note of people and software whose efforts have made SimplePie possible!

Beta 1 had over 1300 downloads, and Beta 2 had over 4000 in the same timeframe! Future releases will have shorter development cycles, but weâ€™d love to see the same kind of success for future versions as we did with Beta 2! Thanks again to all of our users. It is your feedback, patches, bug reports, and other comments that have made SimplePie as successful as it is. We truly appreciate your support!
