For those of you interested in statistical data for SimplePie.org (which is probably only me), I was digging through my stats this morning, and learned the following:

##### Firefox is the most popular browser.

1.  64.7% Firefox
2.  21.8% Internet Explorer
3.  8.5% Safari
4.  2.3% Opera
5.  1.1% Mozilla (not including SeaMonkey)
6.  1.6% Everything else

Firefox users are nearly **triple** the number of IE users, and the Mac-only Safari is nearly at 10%! Additionally, Iâ€™m surprised that there are even 1.1% of people still on the old Mozilla browser.

##### Windows users still dominate, but not like everywhere else.

1.  75.7% Windows
2.  17.3% Mac (WOW!)
3.  6.4% Linux
4.  0.7% Everything else

Mac and Linux users are roughly 25% of all visits! Windows users are still the most prevalent, but with not nearly the lead that have in other markets.

##### Itâ€™s all about the midrange.

98% of all SimplePie users have a screen resolution of 1024Ã—768 or larger, but 62% of those are either at 1024Ã—768 or 1280Ã—1024. That means that SimplePieâ€™s website will have to stay 1024Ã—768-friendly for quite some time to come.

##### Flash 8 is still on top, with Flash 9 coming up quick.

1.  53.6% Flash 8
2.  37.3% Flash 9
3.  8.3% Flash 7
4.  0.7% Everything else

If this in any indicator of the Flash usage (which it probably is), over 99% of all SimplePie users will be able to support the new software weâ€™re using to support Flash Video (.flv) and MP3â€™s on the trunk (to be 1.0). Cool!
