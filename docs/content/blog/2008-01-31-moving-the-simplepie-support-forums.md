In the last post, I talked a little about transition. SimplePie is growing, and is the most popular it has ever been! This means two things:

1. Weâ€™ve got to keep building the best RSS/Atom software available for PHP (and AJAX, and Mobile, and WordPress), andâ€¦
2. Weâ€™ve got a LOT of users to support, with a LOT of questions to answer.

Personally, Iâ€™m currently in the process of wrapping up some work with the Yahoo! Messenger web team, and then ramping up fast on my companyâ€™s WarpShare project to try to have a technology preview ready in time for [South by Southwest: Interactive](http://2008.sxsw.com/). Iâ€™ve been swamped for the last two weeks, then I open up my feed reader this morning, and there are over 70 new SimplePie support requests. Quite frankly, I canâ€™t keep up.

Iâ€™ve already reached a point where Iâ€™m barely able to do any development on SimplePie because of all of the support and maintenance Iâ€™ve been doing, and I really want to get back to developing more. Iâ€™ve spent hours and hours and hours writing tutorials, FAQs, documentation, and example code. We moved all of our docs over to a wiki so that the community could more effectively contribute. I know that some of you help answer questions for others, and thatâ€™s appreciated more than you know. But as a whole, I donâ€™t know if anyone but the development team is subscribed to the RSS feeds for the forum, and can help answer questions more effectively. And I canâ€™t keep taking on this kind of load primarily by myself.

Soâ€¦ in an effort to more effectively push support into the hands of those who are capable of helping, Iâ€™m going to begin the process of shutting down new registrations and posts on the existing support forum (thereby turning it into an archive), and opening up a new [Yahoo! Groups mailing list/forum](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/simplepie-support/). Yahoo! Groups is pretty good, theyâ€™ve got a web-based forum-like view, but most importantly theyâ€™ve got mailing list support.

In my experience, those who are subscribed to a mailing list are able to get more information, and are more capable of contributing to the discussions. And thatâ€™s what we want: more people contributing to the discussions.

Again my schedule is a bit jumbled right now, so this will probably happen sometime over the next few weeks, but itâ€™s coming. By spreading the SimplePie support load more effectively, weâ€™ll have one more developer who can devote more time to improving SimplePieâ€¦ and really, I think thatâ€™s what we all want. ðŸ™‚
