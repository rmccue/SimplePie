[SimplePie 1.0 Beta](/downloads/) is now available for public consumption. Lots of cool new things in this release, as you can check out in the [Version History](/docs/version_history.php). There’s also another entry in the Tips and Tricks section entitled [“Bypass ‘hotlink blocking’ when displaying a feed.”](http://www.simplepie.org/ideas/tips-and-tricks/bypass-hotlink-blocking-when-displaying-a-feed/), and the ever-popular [Del.icio.us](/ideas/demos/delicious-ajax/)/[Last.fm](/ideas/demos/last-fm-ajax/) AJAX demos are also taking advantage of the new features in this release.

All existing SimplePie users are encouraged to upgrade ASAP. No existing functions were changed or depreciated, so you should be able to just drop the new file right in. We do recommend, however, that you take a look at our [Tips and Tricks](/ideas/tips-and-tricks/) section to find ways to optimize your use of SimplePie.
