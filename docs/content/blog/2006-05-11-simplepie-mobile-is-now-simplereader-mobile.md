While we wait for Beta 2 development to wrap up, we’ve gone back and updated SimplePie Mobile with the latest trunk build of SimplePie, revamped the stylesheet to make it more readable, and renamed it to [SimpleReader Mobile](http://mobile.simplereader.com).

**SimpleReader Mobile** is a free, simple, no-nonsense feed reader designed for mobile devices. It has been tested on the Sony PSP, Palm TX’s Blazer browser, and Opera Mini on the Palm TX. If you’re on the go, or simply don’t want to walk over to the computer to read your feeds, you can go load up SimpleReader Mobile and punch in an address like [digg.com](http://digg.com), and instantly be reading the latest postings.

If you have a web-enabled mobile device, why not check it out?
