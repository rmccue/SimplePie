Never one to be content with where we are, we’ve gone ahead and added a new member to our SimplePie family of plugins: the [SimplePie Plugin for Textpattern](/docs/installation/textpattern/).

It’s as easy to install as the WordPress and Mediawiki plugins, and has near-identical syntax as the Mediawiki plugin (where, again, we’ve focused on flexibility and ease of use). SimplePie is considered by many to be one of the best PHP-based feed parsers available, and now you can have that speed, flexiblity and ease-of-use in an easily installable plugin.

So if you’ve got a Textpattern blog, [check it out](/docs/installation/textpattern/)!
