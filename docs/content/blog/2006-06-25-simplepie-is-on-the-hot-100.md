According to the [Museum of Modern Betas](http://momb.socio-kybernetics.net/), SimplePie has made the [“Hot 100” for the week ending on June 25th, 2006](http://momb.socio-kybernetics.net/hot-100).

What is the Hot 100, you ask?

> The hottest betas in the webosphere, as measured by the number of bookmarks at del.icio.us added within the last 7 days. This list will be updated each Sunday.

SimplePie clocked in at number 65. We were bested by [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/) (2), [Netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com/) (9), [Gmail](http://mail.google.com/mail/) (16), [Delicious](http://del.icio.us/) (24), [Newsvine](http://www.newsvine.com/) (36), [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/) (39), and [Magnolia](http://ma.gnolia.com/) (54). However, we ranked higher than projects like [Writely](http://www.writely.com/) (70), [Windows Live](http://www.live.com/) (71), [Blinklist](http://www.blinklist.com/) (77), and [Yahoo!
