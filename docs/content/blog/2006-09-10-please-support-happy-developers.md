For those who are feeling charitable, and like seeing happy developers work on SimplePie, please consider donating in the form of wishlist gratification! ([Geoffrey](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/wishlist/2ASV4RHBSM16H/) and [Ryan](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/KAFYR57E8R81/ref=cm_wl_sortbar_v_page_1/102-2907233-6237735?ie=UTF8&filter=all&sort=priority&layout=standard&reveal=unpurchased)).

If youâ€™re not feeling charitable, thatâ€™s okay too. Just tell other people about how much you like SimplePie, and weâ€™ll call it even. ðŸ˜‰
