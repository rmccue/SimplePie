For anyone who is using the latest development version of SimplePie (known as 1.3-dev), you might have noticed that the readme mentions SimplePie.compiled.php in the same vein as our previous simplepie.inc. However, in the past, you had to check out the entire repository just to build this.

I’m happy to announce that a pre-built version is now available at [dev.simplepie.org](http://dev.simplepie.org/SimplePie.compiled.php). This version is rebuilt within 5 minutes of pushing to GitHub, so it will always be up-to-date with our current development version.

In addition, API documentation built from our PHPDoc comments is now available on [dev.simplepie.org](http://dev.simplepie.org/api/). This documentation is designed to give you a bit more of an insight into the SimplePie API, than the wiki. Don’t worry though, our wiki isn’t going anywhere any time soon!

If you encounter any problems, as usual, let us know via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie/issues).
