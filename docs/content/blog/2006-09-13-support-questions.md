SimplePieâ€™s community of users keeps getting larger and larger, and we think thatâ€™s just dandy. That also means that there have been flood of new questions at the support forums, and I just want to say two things about that.

First is that there is a note near the top of the forum page that is highlighted in yellow, and has a link to the [Bug Reporting Guidelines](/support/viewtopic.php?id=3). Please, understand that it makes our lives MUCH simpler if we have that information when you post about your issue. Iâ€™ll oftentimes need to begin with asking someone what version of SimplePie theyâ€™re using because it simply wasnâ€™t stated up front.

Secondly, because the forum questions have picked up recently, from time to time, a forum question might get overlooked or missed. Itâ€™s not that we donâ€™t want to help you, but occasionally something will get missed. If you think this may have happened, please bump the thread so that we can find your question again.

Thanks for the questions, and weâ€™ll continue to do the best we can to continue answering them. ðŸ™‚
