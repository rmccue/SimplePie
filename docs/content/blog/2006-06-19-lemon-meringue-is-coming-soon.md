Although we weren’t planning to do a Beta 3 (we were just going to go straight into 1.0 RC1 next), we’ve made some under the hood changes to SimplePie that might need additional testing. This should not affect anybody’s existing Beta 2 code, so no worries about that, but we just want more of an opportunity to gather some bug reports. So we’ve decided to shuffle our schedule to meet that need.

Additionally, many of the new features in 1.0 revolved around the ability to read and set HTTP Headers. This code will be landing on the trunk shortly, and then we’ll start working on everything that was dependent on this code. Most of it is relatively simple stuff, but will make SimplePie that much better and more reliable. So, instead of releasing a Beta 2 Bugfix release now, and having everything else wait for 1.0, we’ve decided to release a Beta 3 which will include all of our bugfixes from Beta 2, as well as several features that were originally scheduled for RC1.

We’ll be releasing Beta 3 in the first weekend in July. We’re gonna get as much done as possible until then (which will hopefully be all of it), and will release what we have completed at that time. Anything we miss will be pushed to RC1 (which will be feature-frozen — only bugfixes will be allowed between RC1 and 1.0 final).
