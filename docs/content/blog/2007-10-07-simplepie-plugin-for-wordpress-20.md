It is with great excitement that I release a brand new version of the [SimplePie Plugin for WordPress](@/wiki/plugins/wordpress/simplepie_plugin_for_wordpress/_index.md)! As previously mentioned, this is a complete re-write with some great new features! This is definitely a must-have upgrade!

It should also be noted that weâ€™re now bundling the latest release of SimplePie with the plugin itself, so this should simply be a matter of downloading the plugin, uploading it to your WordPress plugins folder, and activating it.

Check it out! ðŸ™‚
