[Dreamhost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?skyzyx) (our webhost) as informed us that SimplePie.org will be down for scheduled maintenance for about an hour beginning Tuesday, Jan 10 at 11:00pm (Pacific; GMT-8:00).

Across timezones, this is: **London:** Wednesday, Jan 11 at 10:00am (GMT), and **Melbourne:** Wednesday, Jan 11 at 5:00pm (GMT+10:00). Everyone else should be able to figure out where they fall in that schedule.

If you have support issues, or simply canâ€™t wait to download SimplePie again, please wait until after this window has passed. Thanks.
