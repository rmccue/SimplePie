**Introducing [SimplePie Live!](http://live.simplepie.org)** Now, it‚Äôs even easier to get started adding feeds to your websites using the software that has been called [‚Äúan invaluable tool‚Äù](http://www.hotscripts.com/review/60863.html), [‚Äúthe new black this season‚Äù](http://forums.devnetwork.net/viewtopic.php?p=378371#378371), and [‚Äúalmost certainly the best PHP-based parser right now‚Äù](http://sporkmonger.com/articles/2006/02/27/directory-of-feed-parsers).

Like SimplePie, SimplePie Live is a tool for developers designed to be as easy to use as possible. SimplePie Live plays well with modern JavaScript frameworks such as [Prototype](http://prototypejs.org), [MooTools](http://mootools.net), [jQuery](http://jquery.com), and has a syntax that will feel familiar to existing SimplePie users.

Have a look at the [Getting Started Guide](/wiki/live/setup/), the [API Reference](/wiki/live/reference/), and [find out if SimplePie Live! is the right product for you](/more/). Please note that SimplePie Live! is still in ‚ÄúBeta‚Äù, and as such may not be 100% reliable at this point. There will definitely be improvements and enhancements to the service which will be rolled out automatically, causing no work on your part. If we need to roll out an enhancement that will cause compatibility issues, we‚Äôll roll it out as part of a new version, and will notify you via the SimplePie blog about the updates.

Lastly, we‚Äôre moving as fast as we can on writing up the documentation. If there‚Äôs something unclear or hasn‚Äôt been documented yet, feel free to drop into the support forums or IRC and let us know. Also, we‚Äôre always open to suggestions for improvement, so please let us know if you have any of those too. Remember that if you think that any part of this sucks, we can‚Äôt improve it unless we know about it, so please speak up.

Enjoy! üôÇ
