The 1.0 Beta release will bring with it improved support for current features, as well as new features all-together. We’re putting the spit and polish on it as we speak, and are planning to have it out sometime over the weekend.

As a note, this is still a beta, and some things may change a little or a lot by the time 1.0 hits the streets. We’re always open to suggestions, if you want to stop by the [SimplePie forums](http://support.simplepie.org/categories.php), and let us know how we can make it better!
