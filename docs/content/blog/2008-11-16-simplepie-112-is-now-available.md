My departure was never going to be immediate, but I didn’t expect to be doing this (as Ryan always does this); however, the time has come (for me!) to announce the immediate availability of [SimplePie 1.1.2](/downloads/) (“core” plug-ins will be updated soon). This is a bugfix-only release that resolves some of the things that weren’t caught until we after released 1.1.1 (including, interestingly, one very major bug that had existed for years ? it never ceases to amaze me how rarely the web is sensible enough to do what is obvious and should be done to hit such bugs).

Download [the latest release](/downloads/) to upgrade!
