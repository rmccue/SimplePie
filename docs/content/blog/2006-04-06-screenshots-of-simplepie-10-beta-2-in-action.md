No, it hasn’t been released yet (as there are still some issues to work out and a couple more features to add), but everything you see in these screenshots is available in the trunk builds in our [subversion repository](/downloads/). These aren’t all the new features we’ve added, but this should give you a taste of what’s coming. Enjoy.
