For some reason, when I upgraded this site to WordPress 2.0.1, the comments broke. I’ve posted a topic in the [WordPress forums](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/59452), and I’m hoping to get a response soon. In the meantime, I’ll be digging into the issue on my own as well and will hopefully get the comments working again ASAP.

Sorry about this, for those of you who were desperately wanting to post a comment!
