I’m getting reports around the blogosphere that SimplePie was discussed in the “[Primp your blog](http://blogher.org/node/7262)” workshop at the recent [BlogHer ’06](http://blogher.org/) conference in San Jose, CA, USA. I don’t have any transcripts of the conference, but here are a few blog posts that I’ve come across that include SimplePie:
