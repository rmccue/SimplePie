For the past few months I’ve been kicking around the idea of writing a book about SimplePie. This was recently fueled by the mentions of SimplePie in [Professional Search Engine Optimization with PHP](http://www.cristiandarie.ro/seo-php/) as well as Cameron Moll’s recent thoughts on [self-publishing](http://cameronmoll.com/archives/2007/09/on_selfpublishing/). I’m comfortable working in QuarkXPress and InDesign, and I’ve been writing in some sort of fairly substantial capacity for several years now. Perhaps this is the next step to take?

So, I wanted to gauge the interest level of the SimplePie community — you. If we were to write a book, in English, and release it in either PDF or paperback form (likely both), is it something you’d buy? If so, what would you be willing to spend for it? I’ve long been frustrated at the $50 USD technical books because they’re priced above the “easy” price range where you can easily justify spending the money. Books like “Designing with Web Standards” and “Don’t Make Me Think!” went for $35 USD when they first came out, and although that’s better, it still feels a few dollars too high. Initially I’m thinking $25-$30 per paperback copy and $15-20ish for a PDF copy, but of course I’m throwing those numbers out having not attempted to self-publish a book yet. 🙂 “Getting Real” by 37signals went for $17 USD for a PDF (if I remember correctly), so I think this price is in the right range.

My first thoughts for chapters would include:

1.  A history of RSS and Atom, including what it is, politics, etc.
2.  The story of the SimplePie project, how the developers met and started working together
3.  Fundamental PHP basics that you need to understand to use SimplePie
4.  Getting SimplePie set up and installed in a few different environments
5.  Using SimplePie, basics
6.  More advanced usages of SimplePie
7.  Writing your own plugins for third-party software
8.  Writing your own SimplePie Add-ons, extending and overriding SimplePie classes
9.  The new SimplePie Live! (which should definitely be 1.0 by then)

Again, that’s a first pass. I’m interested in finding out what YOU would be interested in learning from such a book. What topics should we delve into? What chapters would be good to have? What kinds of things would you like to know, or have in a book? What do you think about book prices? Too high/low? This book is for YOU and (hopefully) many, many others, so we need your feedback to know what kind of book to write — or if we should even go down such a path. If we wanted to go with a publisher, who do you think would be good to go with?
