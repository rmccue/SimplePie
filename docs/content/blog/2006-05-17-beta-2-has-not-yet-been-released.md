Although weâ€™re very close, Beta 2 has not been officially released yet. The code available in our repository is unfinished code and does not represent the final product.

We will, however, be releasing the final Beta 2 very soon. Keep in mind that after wrapping up development (which will most likely be this weekend), there is still the matter of updating the website with the Beta 2 documentation, as well as other changes that weâ€™re planning to make to the site, which may end up taking most of next week to get everything in order.

So hang on to your britches. You wonâ€™t find information about issues about Beta 2 by Googling, so hang on until we release it. ðŸ™‚
