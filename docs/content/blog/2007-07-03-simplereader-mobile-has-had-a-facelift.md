For those who have been using [SimpleReader Mobile](http://mobile.simplereader.com/) (or simply those who are looking for an iPhone, PSP, Palm, Blackberry, or phone-friendly web-based feed reader), weâ€™ve given it a new facelift! Most devices (like phones, and Blackberrys and such) get a clean, fast, clutter-free view of their favorite feeds. For devices that can handle CSS (e.g. iPhone, PSP, Opera Mini), weâ€™ve got the same thing except that it looks a lot nicer on these devices.

Also for the first time, [SimpleReader Mobile](http://mobile.simplereader.com/) looks pretty good on desktop browsers as well. If youâ€™ve got a mobile device with an internet data plan or WiFi support, give [SimpleReader Mobile](http://mobile.simplereader.com/) a try. Also, for devices that support Flash playback (e.g. PSP), weâ€™ll soon be adding the ability to playback MP3 and FLV enclosures!

[SimpleReader Mobile](http://mobile.simplereader.com/) is powered by the latest version of [SimplePie](/), which means that it supports all the cool, gee-whiz stuff like [Internationalized Domain Names](http://mobile.simplereader.com/?feed=http://www.xn--8ws00zhy3a.com/feed), solid [Atom 1.0 support](http://mobile.simplereader.com/?feed=http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/ongoing.atom), and [Feed Autodiscovery](http://mobile.simplereader.com/?feed=digg.com). Can your other mobile feed reader do that? ðŸ™‚
