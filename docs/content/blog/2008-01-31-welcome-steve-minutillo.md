As Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re aware by now, SimplePie is in a bit of a transition. The project is growing, and weâ€™re up to 4 public products right now (SimplePie, SimplePie Live!, SimplePie for WordPress, and SimpleReader Mobile), weâ€™ve got a good product in SimplePie 1.1, and weâ€™ve got our sights set on SimplePie 2.

As weâ€™ve previously discussed, weâ€™re looking for some new development help. Particularly, people who can help us grow toward our vision â€” not people who want to maintain old PHP 4.x releases after weâ€™ve moved to pure PHP5. The first person to come to mind when we started looking was Steve Minutillo.

Steve is the developer of a web-based feed aggregator called [Feed on Feeds](http://feedonfeeds.com/) that is currently based on SimplePie, so he has experience in using SimplePie for complex projects. Steve has been a very valuable patch contributor up to this point, and he accepted our invitation to join the SimplePie development team.

Weâ€™re still looking for a few more developers to help us grow this project out more. Particularly if youâ€™ve got experience with PHP, RSS/Atom, mobile apps, JSON web service APIs, and the like, weâ€™d love to have you on our team. The best way for us to notice you is to provide detailed bug reports with patches, so if youâ€™re itching to get more involved in your spare time as a contributor/developer, this is the way to do it.

Please take a moment to welcome Steve to the SimplePie team! ðŸ™‚
