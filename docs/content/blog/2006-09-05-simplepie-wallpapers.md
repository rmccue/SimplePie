For those of you who are hardcore about SimplePie and want to show your SimplePie pride, we’ve created the first of (hopefully) many [wallpapers](http://www.flickr.com/photos/skyzyx/sets/72157594171190151/) for your computer desktop. The first one is called [“Dark Star”](http://www.flickr.com/photos/skyzyx/170829827/) and is available in several different sizes.

Are you artistically gifted and want to design your own SimplePie wallpaper to share with the world? Let us know about it in the new [Wallpaper and Graphics](/support/viewforum.php?id=21) forum, and we’ll let the world know about it. Upload the various wallpapers and graphics to your website, we’ll pull them down, and upload them to our graphics repository. We’ll even post about it on the SimplePie blog!

So that you can all have the necessary tools, the font we use is [Yanone Kaffeesatz](http://www.yanone.de/typedesign/kaffeesatz/) (kerned to -4) and the [SimplePie logo](/images/logo_simplepie_template.png) is an editable Macromedia Fireworks PNG (for smaller uses of the logo, I remove the outer border and the top layer). Since this is **our** logo, I would ask that you refrain from using our logo for anything other than SimplePie-related wallpapers and graphics.

(The SimplePie logo is copyrighted by Ryan Parman. All rights reserved. A license to use this logo is granted exclusively for the designing of SimplePie-related graphics, and is not to be used for any other purpose.)

If possible, when you create your wallpapers, please create them in the following sizes:

- 480 x 272 (for PSP)
- 800 x 600
- 1024 x 768
- 1280 x 1024
- 1440 x 900
- 1600 x 1024
- 1680 x 1050
- 1920 x 1200
- 2560 x 1600

Enjoy!
