Since we use [Basecamp](http://basecamphq.com/?referrer=skyzyx) to manage SimplePie development, weâ€™ve decided to hook directly into our to-do lists for the Beta 3 and RC1 releases, as well as the list for the next version of the plugin engine (which is shared between the WordPress, Textpattern, and Mediawiki plugins).

These to-do lists are _live_! We have not added any sort of caching even (although this might have to change soon), so the lists in our new [Development](/development/) section are accurate up-to-the-instant. So if youâ€™re interested in what _will actually be worked on_, check it out. Itâ€™ll be automatically updated as we check things off or add new items to the lists.

I donâ€™t think you can be a more transparent open-source project than that! ðŸ™‚
