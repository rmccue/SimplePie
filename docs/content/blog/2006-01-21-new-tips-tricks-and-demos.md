As we get ready for the impending release of SimplePie 1.0 Beta, we’ve decided to put together a couple of new [ideas](/ideas/). The first discusses how to [display non-english feeds correctly](/ideas/tips-and-tricks/display-non-english-feeds-correctly/) (or even english feeds that just have different character encodings), while the other is a [Last.fm AJAX](/ideas/demos/last-fm-ajax/) demo built in the same vein as the earlier [Del.icio.us AJAX](/ideas/demos/delicious-ajax/) demo.

Check ’em out! Maybe they’ll give you ideas for what else you can use SimplePie for…
