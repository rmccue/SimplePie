I bought the wife an iPhone for her birthday, so I figured I would do some testing with it. Although SimpleReader Mobile looks cool on it, I felt it could use some polish to really make it fit with the rest of the iPhone’s user interface. I decided to spend some time with [iUI](http://www.joehewitt.com/iui/), a mini-framework for building webapps with an iPhone-friendly UI. iUI was created by Joe Hewitt — the same guy who developed the [Firebug](http://getfirebug.com) extension for Firefox.

If you have an iPhone, you should find the SimpleReader Mobile interface now fits better with the rest of the iPhone UI. At the moment, internationalized domain names don’t work for the iPhone version (the main version still works fine), but I’ll make sure that gets fixed soon.

Give it a whirl!
