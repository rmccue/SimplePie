Previously, we were using Lussumo’s [Vanilla forum software](http://getvanilla.com/), but it never felt quite right to use, was difficult to customize, and I really just didn’t like it. [PunBB](http://punbb.org/), however, is solid forum software that feels like a forum, is well supported, and is easy to customize. I think that this is a good move for us.

The flip-side of that is the fact that (a) <del>you’ll need to re-register at the forums, and</del> (b) I copy-pasted all of the forum topics from the old forum into the current forum, meaning that all old posts are said to have been made by me. Most of the old issues have been closed, so this shouldn’t be such a big deal, but if you see “Skyzyx” as the author for everything, then you know why.

Anyways, sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused, but this should turn out to be a good move overall.
