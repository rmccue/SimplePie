First off, [SimplePie has been dugg](http://digg.com/programming/SimplePie:_RSS_Parser_for_PHP_That_Trumps_Magpie) (or is it “digged”?). If you like SimplePie, or even care anything about it at all, please digg the article! We’re stoked that we’ve been ushered into the world of being paid attention to.

Secondly, [SimplePie is now an entry at Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimplePie)! We’re still working on some of the details about the projects history and some features and stuff, but feel free to read what’s there and make ntoes of your own, if you so choose.

Lastly, SimplePie now has it’s own [IRC channel](irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/simplepie) on irc.freenode.net, `#simplepie`. This address will be posted in the forums, as well as on our soon-coming contact page. If you’re into IRC, go check it out.
