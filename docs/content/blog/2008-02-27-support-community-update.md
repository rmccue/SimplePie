This is just a note to let everyone know that the [old support site](/support/) has been officially moved to read-only status. No new registrations will be accepted on the old site, and no one is allowed to post. The site is still searchable, however, so that might be a good place to find answers before posting to the [new mailing list](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/simplepie-support/). Bug reports should be directed to [bugs.simplepie.org](http://bugs.simplepie.org), as we finally have some REAL bug tracking software installed (as previously noted).

I know that the move to [Yahoo! Groups](http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/simplepie-support/) has been a controversial one, but all-in-all, we‚Äôve got nearly 70 members subscribed in a fairly short period of time. Things seem to be going okay for now, and hopefully things will only get better in the future ‚Äî although I will miss some of you who are boycotting the new group. üôÅ

We highly encourage you, if you‚Äôre not already, to make use of the **mailing list** feature of Y! Groups. Putting yourself on the mailing list allows you to see all of the questions AND answers that come through. It‚Äôs a great way to learn about SimplePie, even if you don‚Äôt post anything, and if you see a question that you can answer, then please do. Having a mailing list where people _actually use_ the mailing list, makes the give and take much better.

Geoffrey, Steve, and I absolutely want everyone who has a question to be able to get an answer, even if we don‚Äôt have the time to give those answers ourselves (we‚Äôve also got other jobs, other projects, time with family, and other important things that go on in our lives). This needs to become a support community that is _by users, for users_. I don‚Äôt know if anyone believes in karma, but if you want an answer, make sure you give an answer. Even if you‚Äôre new, you can always help another newcomer by pointing them to a tutorial or documentation or something. All of our documentation is in a wiki so that anyone can edit, clarify, improve, and add to the documentation. We encourage it!

Thanks for reading, and we hope that this support community can be even better than the old fora/forums were! üôÇ
