Weâ€™ve made some minor updates to [SimpleReader Mobile](http://m.simplepie.org) for iPhone/iPod touch users.

1. iPod touch now gets the fancy iPhone view.
2. Now that the latest firmware update (1.1.3) allows iPhone and iPod touch users to add websites to their home screen, weâ€™ve added the blue SimpleReader logo as the default icon so it looks nice. This particular feature hasnâ€™t yet been tested as I donâ€™t have my wifeâ€™s iPhone on-hand to test with, but Iâ€™ve followed Appleâ€™s documentation, so Iâ€™m assuming itâ€™s right. If not, Iâ€™ll have it fixed as soon as I can get my hands on her iPhone.

That is all. ðŸ™‚
