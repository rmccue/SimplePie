Weâ€™re slipping the SimplePie Blackberry/Live schedules by one week. I was unable to wrap up development on LIVE because my computer was in repair at Apple for 2 weeks. I just got it back on Friday, and spent the weekend getting everything re-installed from scratch. Geoffrey also spent the weekend getting his computer set up from scratch, but thatâ€™s because he got a brand-new MacBook Pro recently.

Either way, we need a little more time to wrap things up on both fronts, so weâ€™ll plan to have two awesome releases this upcoming weekend. ðŸ™‚
