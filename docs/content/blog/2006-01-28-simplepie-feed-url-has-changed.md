If you’ve already subscribed to the SimplePie blog feed, please update your feed readers to use <http://feeds.feedburner.com/simplepie>.

I would just redirect it with `mod_rewrite`, but I’m not sure if that’ll foul up WordPress at all. Hopefully it wouldn’t, but please just update your feeds anyways.

Thanks, and sorry for the hassle.
