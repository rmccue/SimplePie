_This post was originally entitled “Handbrake doesn’t care about black people… I mean end-users.” After reading through some of the comments made by the Handbrake developers at the bottom of this page, it seems that they do care about end-users… they’re just frustrated by bad end-users. Thanks for the dialog and clarification, Handbrake team!_

First off, I need to clarify that the title of this post is a joke in reference to idiot rapper [Kanye West’s claim](http://youtube.com/watch?v=zIUzLpO1kxI) that “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.”

Now that we have that settled, I came across a [posting on Handbrake’s support forums](http://handbrake.m0k.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=501) that irritated me to no end, and I felt I need to share. If you’ve never heard of Handbrake, the team describes their project as “…an open-source, GPL-licensed, multiplatform, multithreaded DVD to MPEG-4 ripper/converter, available for MacOS X, Linux and Windows.” It’s a cool piece of software for exercising your fair use rights that the DMCA has attempted to take away from us.

If you haven’t read the above linked post, please read it before moving on. I’ll wait.

My first response when I read this was “No, no, no, no, no!” Now, the posting begins with a few bullet points that I generally agree with. Yes, software innovation is good. Yes, code inspection by other peers is good. No, it’s not cool when people come and begin demanding features immediately. No, it’s not cool to hassle or insult the developers. But from there, the author completely misses the point of writing software for other people to use.

Now, maybe the author has reached that point because the Handbrake community has had a number of “bad egg” users who hassle the developers like they owe them something. I feel very fortunate to be part of the SimplePie community which rarely ever has bad eggs or raving lunatics demanding features be built right this second. But even then, who are they building the software for?

Communities are very important to software projects. Bug reports, patches, feature requests, and all sorts of other things are important parts of the growth of a product. No, we don’t always have time to answer support forums in the timeliest of manners, and no we can’t implement every single feature that gets asked for. But we certainly listen, and we certainly try to work in the more relevant and useful features, and we’re always looking for ways to make things simpler for people either by a change in SimplePie or a tutorial and/or code sample of some sort. Why? Because this project would never have become as good as it has without our users and their feedback.

Handbrake’s team seems to think that they are just fine without end-user support. They seem to believe that they already know what is best for Handbrake, and that there’s no suggestion their users can make that they haven’t already thought of. GIVE. ME. A. BREAK. SimplePie started out as one guy scratching an itch and opening up the source for code review and suggestions. It was built around a series of functions, only supported one feed per page, and had maybe 5 users. Nowadays, SimplePie is being used by thousands and thousands of people all over the world, it’s fully object-oriented, supports all sorts of specifications, supports several feeds per page, and a whole variety of other cool features. Why? Because we already know what’s best and don’t want your input? No, no, no. SimplePie is successful because we listen to our users. I never envisioned SimplePie would be able to do the things it can now. We know that we’ve got good people in our community who have all sorts of ideas about how SimplePie could be better — and it shows!

So, best of luck to Handbrake. They seem like they know how successful they want their project to be. As for myself, I’ve deleted my copy of Handbrake and will look elsewhere for my video transcoding needs.
