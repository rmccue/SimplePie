SimplePie 1.0 is now available. This release fixes the remainder of the bugs that we were made aware of (with the exception of one or two that actually stem from PHP bugs).

This release comes 5 days short of the 3-year anniversary of the first public release of SimplePie! We’ve also had upwards of 2,500 downloads of the three release candidates over the past 3 weeks, so we’re thrilled to be able to deliver a solid release for all of us!
