Just wanted to let everyone know there was an error in the documentation for the [SimplePie Plugin for WordPress](/wiki/plugins/wordpress/simplepie_plugin_for_wordpress/customization). The error was the per feed “process” override keyword was mislabeled “process**es**” when it should of been “process**ing**“. How did I figure this out? I’ll tell you how I figured this out: After hours of grueling work going over the source code with a fine toothed comb and finding Nada, I did the only thing I could, I guessed.
