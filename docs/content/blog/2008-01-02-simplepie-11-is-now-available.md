[SimplePie 1.1 is now available.](/downloads/) This release adds some features that we’d wanted to put into 1.0, but didn’t have the time to. It also squashes lots of miscellaneous bugs. This release is API-compatible with previous 1.0.x releases, so it should be as simple as a drop-in replacement. Feel free to check out the [release notes](@/wiki/misc/release_notes/simplepie_1.1.md) for more details.

It should also be noted that PHP 4.x has been officially end-of-life’d, so as per [previous discussion on the topic](/blog/2007/07/13/simplepie-is-going-php5-only/), we’ll be phasing out PHP 4 support over the next release or two, and we’ll be nudging all of you still on PHP 4 to either upgrade to PHP 5 or change hosts (shameless plug: sign up for [Dreamhost](http://dreamhost.com/r.cgi?skyzyx) with the `SIMPLEPIE` promo code, and get $20 USD off the 1-year plan).

We’re also looking at a much shorter schedule for the 1.2 release. In the meantime, if you’re interested in helping develop SimplePie as Geoffrey begins to transition off the project, please get in touch ASAP so we can begin getting you up-to-speed and working out the details.

**Update:** We’re keeping track of [known issues](@/wiki/misc/release_notes/simplepie_1.1.md#known_issues), if you want to see the list.
