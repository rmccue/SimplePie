In episode \#64 of the [Loose Ends Show](http://looseendsshow.com/index.php?post_id=157843) podcast, Tom Sidock talks about WordPress and says that “SimplePie is awesome!”

The segment on WordPress begins around 10:05, while the SimplePie Plugin for WordPress is mentioned at 22:30 and is talked about for around 45 seconds or so.

The entire WordPress segment is good (didn’t listen to the rest of the podcast), so check it out!
