SimplePie 1.0.1 is now available. We fixed a few issues that we werenâ€™t made aware of until after 1.0 had shipped, so if there were some things that were broken in 1.0, hopefully theyâ€™ve been fixed. We know that there are more issues that were encountered, and weâ€™re doing our best to figure out whatâ€™s causing them so that we can fix them.

Obviously, when posting to the forums, please use the Posting Guidelines (noted in the giant red box near the top of every forum page â€” itâ€™s hard to miss), and give us as much information as possible. Thanks! ðŸ™‚
