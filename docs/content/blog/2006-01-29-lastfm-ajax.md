**Update (2 October 2007):** This demo is WAAAAAAAAYYY outdated, and didn’t work anymore with newer versions of SimplePie. Since then, we’ve released the awesome [SimplePie Live!](http://live.simplepie.org) service which is much better geared for AJAX-style uses. Check out the updated [Last.fm AJAX tutorial](/wiki/live/tutorial/lastfm).
