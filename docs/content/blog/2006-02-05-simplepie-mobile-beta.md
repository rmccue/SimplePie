We’ve taken the SimplePie demo, and stripped it down into the perfect online RSS and Atom feed reader for mobile devices. We call it [SimplePie Mobile](http://mobile.simplepie.org). Using XHTML and CSS, we were able to keep the page size small, and although the site may look funny in a desktop browser, it’s a perfect fit for my [Sony PSP](http://www.us.playstation.com/psp.aspx) and [Palm TX](http://www.palm.com/us/products/handhelds/tx/).

We just put this together today, so there are bound to be some issues here and there. We’ll be working on perfecting this service over time. Also remember that SimplePie itself is still in Beta, and we’re working hard on upcoming releases.

Got a PSP, Palm, or web-enabled cell phone? Take [SimplePie Mobile](http://mobile.simplepie.org) for a spin.
