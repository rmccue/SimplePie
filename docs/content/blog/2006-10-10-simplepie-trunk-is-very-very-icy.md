Icy? What that means is that although itâ€™s not outright _frozen_, the only changes to SimplePie will be in the form of last-minute fixes and tweaks as we get ready to go live with an official Beta 3 release. Weâ€™ll be focusing on bug testing as opposed to bug fixing at this point.

If your bug or feature request didnâ€™t make it into this round, donâ€™t worry. Weâ€™ll soon be releasing very frequent release candidates in an effort to patch bugs and resolve issues leading up to our 1.0 release. There were a TON of bugs reported on Beta 2, and weâ€™ve gotten to as many of them as we can up to this point, but we need to get a new release out soon, so some things must be left for the next release. If you have questions about what weâ€™ve got on our roadmap as far as features, fixes, and bugs for the upcoming releases, please check out our [Development](/development/) page for more information.

If those of you who are using the development builds think that thereâ€™s an outstanding issue with SimplePie that is serious enough to hold back the release, please post about it in the [Trunk Builds](/support/viewforum.php?id=12) forum with _\[BLOCKER\]_ in the subject line. Make sure that youâ€™re using the absolute latest development build before you post, and be prepared to either fight for the blocker status, or come with a patch to fix it. We like patches. Weâ€™ll review the ones marked BLOCKER, and if the workload required to fix the bug before this release is justified, weâ€™ll add it to our Beta 3 checklist.

Thank you again to all of you who use SimplePie! Weâ€™re working as hard as we can to make it better and better with each new release, and itâ€™s people who report bugs to the forums who help us accomplish that. ðŸ™‚
