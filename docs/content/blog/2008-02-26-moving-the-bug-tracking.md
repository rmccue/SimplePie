Since SimplePie 1.0 Preview Release 1 was released back in January 2006, we’ve used the fora (running PunBB) as a bug tracker ? mainly because of my hatred of the usability of almost all bug trackers. A few weeks ago, I came across [Redmine](http://redmine.org/): _the first bug tracker I’ve ever been happy using_. I admit, I’m not overly pleased with 0.6.3 (the current release), as the link to submit a new issue is amazingly hidden, and it is impossible to upload anything from Safari 3 (and from other browsers in some circumstances).

However, _the current development copy is far better_, and removes all the issues I had with it. Submitting a new issue is now very obvious (a “New Issue” tab within the project), and the other was [fixed](http://www.redmine.org/issues/show/593) in twenty minutes (now that is what I wish every project was like ? but we aren’t there ourselves).

The [new bug tracker](http://bugs.simplepie.org/) has all issues that are scheduled to be (or already are) done in 1.1.1 and later. I think I’ve got all the bugs that currently affect SimplePie in it: if I haven’t, could you please either reply to a current thread on the fora about the bug, or add it to the new bug tracker?

I hope this is far less [controversial](/blog/2008/01/31/moving-the-simplepie-support-forums/#comments) than the move of the support fora, but to defend that: I have posted **far** more to it than I would have if the support was still dealt with through fora. _I believe moving the bug tracking will be universally helpful to everyone either using SimplePie, or developing it._

Oh, and yes, this does mean I’m still around: I didn’t just disappear off the face of the earth at the end of December. I’m still around. I will be development lead of SimplePie 2 until it ships, and be involved with it for far longer than that (though doing very little development). My departure from SimplePie is far from immediate (though I have for the most part left SimplePie 1 development, following the release of 1.1 last month), and I knew without question that SimplePie would survive: there are enough people who want it to continue to keep it from dying, and there are plenty of people who already know the SimplePie 1 codebase well (such as Steve, who is now himself a developer) that I knew would help, if asked (myself and Ryan had discussed adding other developers around a year ago, before there was even any thought about me leaving). _Myself stepping down really doesn’t mean that much in terms of the future of SimplePie._ The decision wasn’t sudden, either: I first thought about leaving SimplePie back in November, and first spoke to anyone about doing so in mid-December ? _I want SimplePie to succeed more than most, I expect, despite not even having used it myself since 2006._
