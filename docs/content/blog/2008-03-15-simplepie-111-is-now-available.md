[SimplePie 1.1.1](/downloads/) is now available (also in a [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simplepie-core/) flavor). This is a bugfix-only release that resolves some of the things that weren’t caught until we released 1.1.

Fixes include the resolution of [blank enclosures](http://bugs.simplepie.org/issues/show/2), [“Feed not found” errors when the cache expired](http://bugs.simplepie.org/issues/show/5), [problems with UTF-16LE data in the set_raw_data() config option](http://bugs.simplepie.org/issues/show/20), and an [updated add_to_digg() URL](http://bugs.simplepie.org/issues/show/30).

Grab [the latest release](/downloads/) to upgrade!
