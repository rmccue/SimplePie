I had a couple of people ask me about the license that we were using. Some suggested that since it was a Share-alike license, that they wouldn’t be able to use SimplePie in their project because the licenses were different.

After taking another look, I discussed possible solutions with [Geoffrey](http://geoffers.uni.cc). He suggested I look at the licenses at opensource.org. I looked through some of them—namely the zlib/libpng license, as well as the MIT license, but I felt that they were both a bit unstructured for what I was looking for. I went back to the [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org) site, and decided to settle on the Creative Commons [Attribution License](http://www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/). Essentially, it’s as open as any of the “open source” licenses as far as use, copying, and distribution go, but it requires that users must leave all copyright notices intact—which was the main thing I was looking for.

So there you go. You can use SimplePie however you want, in whatever projects you want, as long as the copyright notice in the source code stays in place. Happy distributing!
