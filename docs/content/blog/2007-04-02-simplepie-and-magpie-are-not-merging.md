Just for the record, SimplePie and MagpieRSS are not actually merging. Geoffrey and I came up with the idea for the April Foolâ€™s joke on Friday, and I got in touch with Kellan (from the MagpieRSS project). He said he was cool with the joke, but unfortunately wouldnâ€™t have time to update the MagpieRSS site with a similar notice.

There were a few blog posts from around the web that we saw, as well as [a new digg](http://digg.com/software/SimplePie_and_Magpie_are_joining_the_forces_ultimate_RSS_reader_soon)! No, NeoPie doesnâ€™t actually exist, and no our teams are not merging. We just thought itâ€™d be a funny prank. ðŸ™‚

Thanks to Kellan for being cool about the joke and playing along.
