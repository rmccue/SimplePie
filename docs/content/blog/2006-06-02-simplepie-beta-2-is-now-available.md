After several months of toiling over this release, and the past few weekends pouring over the documentation, we are now very proud to release **SimplePie Beta 2!**

Nearly every major feature has been enhanced, as well as the addition of several new ones. Be sure to read the [upgrade docs](/docs/upgrade/) if youâ€™re upgrading from Beta 1 or the Preview Release. People who were using trunk builds should be able to just drop this file in as a replacement for any previous `simplepie.inc` file.

Weâ€™ve also added a [WordPress plugin](/docs/installation/wordpress/) and a [MediaWiki extension](/docs/installation/mediawiki/) to the mix. And as always, if you have any questions, comments, or need clarification on anything, be sure to swing by the [support forums](/support/). Weâ€™re there a lot. ðŸ™‚

Enjoy!
