In the world of the web, you oftentimes don’t deal with people. If you have a problem, it’s not like you can walk to the counter and ask a clerk or sales person. Instead, you have the digital equivalent of customer service: user experience.

In truth, they’re both essentially the same thing. Whereas [I wrote about customer service](/blog/2006/06/25/example-of-how-not-to-take-care-of-your-customers/) more generically, [Zeldman has written about it](http://zeldman.com/2006/06/29/the-power-of-positive-whining/) more specifically.
