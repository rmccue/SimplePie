Weâ€™re now supporting a technology called OpenID for comments. What does that mean for you? It means that you can sign-in and comment on our blog with your existing account from Google/Gmail, Yahoo!, Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, Windows Live, Hotmail, Flickr, AOL, Blogger, WordPress.com, and others!

If you already have a registered account on our blog for commenting, you can sign-in with your existing account. From there, you can (optionally) add a third-party account that you can login with instead.

That is all. ðŸ™‚
