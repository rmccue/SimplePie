We’ve branched our Beta 3 “Lemon Meringue” release. There’s one more patch to apply to it before we release it, but we didn’t want to hold back work on our 1.0 “Razzleberry” release any more than we had to. Over the next few days we’ll be updating the documentation, testing the plugins, and making sure everything is ready to go for our Beta 3 release!

Some things are changing in Razzleberry that break compatibility with prior trunk builds. If you grab a trunk build today, it won’t work as-is with your existing code, as we’ve made a few changes for the sake of consistency (these are Betas, after all). Once we hit 1.0 we won’t be breaking any existing API’s in the 1.x series of releases. We’ll save API breakage for our 2.0 release (whenever that happens to be).

Rest assured that a new official release will be made public sometime in the next week.
