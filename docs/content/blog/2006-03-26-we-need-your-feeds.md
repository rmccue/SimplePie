RSS and Atom feeds that aren’t either UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1 have proven difficult to find, so I’m calling out to all of you. If you read or publish feeds that are in a character set other than these two, please post them here in the comments. We’ve just finished adding `iconv` support to SimplePie, and want to test that support (it’s in the trunk build as of this moment). Any help along these lines would be appreciated.
