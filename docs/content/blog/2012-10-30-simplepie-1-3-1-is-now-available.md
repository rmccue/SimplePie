SimplePie 1.3.1 is [now available](https://simplepie.org/downloads/)! This is a bugfix release, which fixes a few bugs including [a URI-parsing bug](https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie/issues/214) and an [issue if DOMDocument doesnâ€™t exist](https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie/issues/241). In addition, the various methods deprecated in 1.3 now fail with an `E_DEPRECATED` error rather than simply having the methods not exist. For a full list of what has been changed in this version, see [the commits since 1.3](https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie/compare/1.3...1.3.1), and [the issues closed in 1.3.1](https://github.com/simplepie/simplepie/issues?milestone=9&state=closed). This is a recommended upgrade for all users.
