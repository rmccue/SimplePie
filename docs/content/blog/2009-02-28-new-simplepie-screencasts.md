It would appear that this is the season for SimplePie screencasts! In the past two days, I’ve discovered a few new SimplePie-related screencasts, and I want to share them (and a couple of older ones) with you.

- **[Introduction to SimplePie](/tutorials/introduction_to_simplepie.mov)** ? Ryan Parman gives you a solid once-over about setting up SimplePie, merging feeds together, auto-discovery, and a few other popular features.
- **[Adding RSS Content with SimplePie](http://css-tricks.com/video-screencasts/55-adding-rss-content-with-simplepie/)** ? Chris Coyier discusses more of the basics from another developer’s perspective.
- **[Quick Tip: Super SimplePie!](http://www.nikibrown.com/designoblog/2009/02/10/quick-tip-16-super-simple-pie/)** ? Niki Brown quickly shows you how to drop RSS content into an existing page.
- **[CodeIgniter and SimplePie](http://www.viddler.com/explore/elliothaughin/videos/10/)** ? Elliot Haughin shows how to integrate SimplePie into your CodeIgniter projects.
- **[Extending SimplePie to Parse Unique RSS Feeds](http://net.tutsplus.com/videos/screencasts/extending-simplepie-to-parse-unique-rss-feeds/)** ? Jeffrey Way dives a bit deeper and talks about how to extend SimplePie’s functionality while playing with a little jQuery.

You can find even more tips, tricks, tutorials, and screencasts in the [SimplePie wiki](@/wiki/tutorial/_index.md).
