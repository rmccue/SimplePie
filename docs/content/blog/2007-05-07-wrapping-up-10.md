We’re wrapping up 1.0 development as we speak. There is still one major feature and a few bugs to take care of, but for the most part SimplePie 1.0 is ready to go! If you’ve got any bugs to report on the development trunk, now is the time to report them! We’ll be releasing the first release candidate shortly along with a refresh of our website (the information is starting to grow larger than the site was built for!).

We’ll also be moving all of our documentation to a wiki so that documentation, tutorials, and tips and tricks can be a community effort. We’ve been fortunate to attract some very knowledgeable users over the last year-and-a-half since our Preview Release, and we want to make room for the power users to be able to contribute more than they’re currently able to.

Our plug-in collection has also grown tremendously in the last year! Not only do we have plug-ins for WordPress, Textpattern, and Mediawiki, but we’ve also got various plug-ins for Joomla, Drupal, MODx, PunBB, CakePHP, and we’ve even been integrated directly into projects such as Dokuwiki (among others)! If you’re a user of one of these plug-ins, thank the awesome members of our community for making it happen!

Anyways, enough of the chit-chat. Back to work for us.
