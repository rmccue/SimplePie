Just hours after we released version 1.0PR, one of our beta testers discovered a bug that could potentially throw PHP into an infinite loop causing crashes and such. Because of this, we’ve released an update that fixes this critical issue. If you’ve already downloaded the Preview Release, please [upgrade to this version](/downloads/) ASAP.
