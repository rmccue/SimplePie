It would appear that someone has brute-forced our admin password, and has been using our webserver to send out a bunch of spam. Dreamhost alerted us of this, and Iâ€™ve gone back and changed a bunch of passwords.

If youâ€™ve been receiving spam from people at `@simplepie.org` email addresses, then we apologize. Itâ€™s not us. Iâ€™m going to make sure that everything appears kosher, and then re-enable our ability to send email for \*good\* purposes. ðŸ™‚
