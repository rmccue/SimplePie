SimplePie “Lemon Meringue”, our upcoming Beta 3 release, was initially scheduled for this weekend. Unfortunately, it’s taking a bit longer than anticipated to get something solid together. We’ve been doing a lot of bug fixing and implementing some feature requests, but we’re also going through and re-organizing everything — streamlining things to make SimplePie a bit smaller and more efficient.

Because of all of these changes, we haven’t been checking anything into the public repository for about 2 weeks now, as everything is still unstable. I would love to give a release date, but at the moment I can’t. All I can say is that it really is coming, and we should be checking in regular trunk builds again very soon with an official Beta 3 release coming soon afterwords.
