We want to thank you all for what we consider a fairly successful launch of our Beta 2 release! In our first week, we had 208 downloads of SimplePie, which is good considering how little-known our project is up to this point.

We’d love to see where SimplePie is being used! If you could drop us a line and let us know how you’re using it — even if you think it’s in a boring way — we’d love to hear about it. Also, although adding a link back to us is definitely not required, we would certainly appreciate it. The more people using this product, and the more feedback we get, the better we can make SimplePie!

Thanks again for a great launch!
