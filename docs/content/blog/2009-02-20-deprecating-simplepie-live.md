Although [SimplePie Live!](http://live.simplepie.org) was a cool concept, and something that I would have liked to see be successful, I simply haven’t had the time to put into it for nearly a year and a half now. One of these days I’d like to relaunch it when I have more time and resources to put into it, because I believe it could be a useful tool if executed properly.

That being said, we’ll be shutting down the SimplePie Live! service in the next couple of weeks. This will be the only notice we’ll provide (which probably isn’t a big deal because there are nearly zero users). Instead, I would recommend either using SimplePie (for PHP) or a service like [Google AJAX Feed API](http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxfeeds/).
