When we launched the first release candidate build of SimplePie 1.0 in June, we also pushed out a series of updates to our website — the biggest of which was a complete revamp of our documentation and moving it all to a [Dokuwiki](http://dokuwiki.org) installation. Over the past 6 weeks or so, we’ve continued to add more and more information to help people make the most of SimplePie.

If you haven’t checked these out yet, I’d like to let you know about them.

- **[Tips, Tricks, Tutorials, and Screencasts](@/wiki/tutorial/_index.md)** — We’ve spent a lot of time adding helpful tutorials and code samples, as well as adding some narrated screencasts showing the actual creation of things.
- **[SimplePie Plugins](@/wiki/plugins/_index.md)** — At the moment, there are a variety of software packages that either SimplePie has a plugin for, SimplePie has been integrated into the core of, or SimplePie can be easily added as a component of. The ones we’re aware of are discussed on this page, but we know there are lots more!
- **[SimplePie Add-ons](@/wiki/addons/_index.md)** — SimplePie Add-ons extend SimplePie, allowing it to do new things! There are a handful of add-ons currently available, and as more people begin to see the benefits we expect this part of the SimplePie community to really grow.
- **[Ideas and Inspiration](@/wiki/ideas/_index.md)** — People are using SimplePie for lots and lots of different projects, and we’re seeing SimplePie used in all sorts of ways that we never even imagined. This section contains links to sites that are using SimplePie, in an effort to stimulate new ideas and new inspiration.

I’d encourage you to check these things out if you haven’t already as the community is adding new content all the time. If you have something cool or useful to contribute, please feel free to add it to the wiki yourself.
